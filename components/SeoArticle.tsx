            <h3 id="how-qr-codes-work">How Do QR Codes Work? The Anatomy of a Scan</h3>
            <p>At its core, a Quick Response (QR) code is a two-dimensional barcode. Unlike the one-dimensional barcodes on products that store limited data horizontally, QR codes store information in both horizontal and vertical patterns of black and white squares, called "modules." This structure allows them to hold significantly more data.</p>
            <p>The scanning process relies on key components within the QR code's pattern:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Position Detection Patterns:</strong> These are the three large squares located in the corners of the QR code (top-left, top-right, and bottom-left). They are the first thing a scanner looks for, allowing it to quickly identify the presence of a QR code and determine its orientation. This is why you can scan a QR code from any angle, even upside down.</li>
              <li><strong>Alignment Patterns:</strong> These are smaller squares found within the code's pattern, especially in larger QR codes. They help the scanner correct for distortion if the code is on a curved surface or scanned at an angle.</li>
              <li><strong>Timing Patterns:</strong> These are alternating black and white modules that run horizontally and vertically between the three main position detection patterns. They define the size of the data matrix, allowing the scanner to determine the size of each individual module.</li>
              <li><strong>Quiet Zone:</strong> This is the mandatory blank white space surrounding the QR code. It's crucial for helping the scanner differentiate the code from its surroundings. A lack of a sufficient quiet zone is a common reason for scanning failures.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you point your smartphone camera at a QR code, the device's software instantly recognizes these patterns, deciphers the encoded data (be it a URL, text, or Wi-Fi credentials), and presents you with the relevant action, like opening a webpage.</p>

            <h3 id="static-vs-dynamic">Static vs. Dynamic QR Codes: What's the Difference?</h3>
            <p>Understanding the distinction between static and dynamic QR codes is crucial for any marketing strategy.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Static QR Codes:</strong> The data is encoded directly into the pattern of the QR code itself. Once a static QR code is generated and printed, the information it points to cannot be changed. They are ideal for permanent information, such as a website homepage URL, contact information on a business card, or Wi-Fi network details. The codes generated by this tool are static.</p>
              <p><strong>Dynamic QR Codes:</strong> These codes contain a short, fixed URL that redirects the user to the actual destination URL. The magic lies in that the destination URL can be changed at any time without altering the QR code itself. This makes them incredibly powerful for marketing campaigns, as you can update a link on a printed poster long after it has been distributed. Dynamic QR codes often require a subscription service that manages the redirection and provides valuable analytics, such as scan counts, locations, and times.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3 id="error-correction">The Magic of Reed-Solomon Error Correction</h3>
            <p>One of the most remarkable features of QR codes is their resilience. You've likely seen QR codes with logos in the middle or even ones that are partially scratched or dirtied, yet they still scan perfectly. This is thanks to the Reed-Solomon error correction algorithm, a sophisticated mathematical concept that adds redundant data to the code's structure.</p>
            <p>There are four levels of error correction:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Level L (Low):</strong> Can restore up to 7% of damaged data.</li>
              <li><strong>Level M (Medium):</strong> Can restore up to 15% of damaged data. (Most common)</li>
              <li><strong>Level Q (Quartile):</strong> Can restore up to 25% of damaged data.</li>
              <li><strong>Level H (High):</strong> Can restore up to 30% of damaged data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The trade-off is simple: a higher error correction level means more redundant data is stored, which increases the density of the QR code and reduces its maximum data capacity. For most applications, Level M offers a good balance between robustness and capacity. For artistic codes with logos or codes placed in environments where they might get damaged, Level H is the preferred choice.</p>

            <h3 id="business-use-cases">Common Business Use Cases for QR Codes</h3>
            <p>The versatility of QR codes has led to their adoption across numerous industries:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Marketing & Advertising:</strong> Linking print ads, billboards, and product packaging to campaign landing pages, video demonstrations, or social media profiles.</li>
              <li><strong>Restaurants & Hospitality:</strong> Providing contactless menus, linking to reservation systems, or offering Wi-Fi access.</li>
              <li><strong>Retail:</strong> Sharing product information, linking to reviews, offering discounts, or facilitating mobile payments.</li>
              <li><strong>Events & Networking:</strong> Sharing event schedules, speaker bios, or digital business cards (vCards).</li>
              <li><strong>Logistics & Manufacturing:</strong> Tracking inventory and managing supply chains with QR codes on parts and packages.</li>
              <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Providing patients with access to their medical records, appointment details, or educational materials.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices for Design and Scannability</h3>
            <p>To ensure your QR codes are effective, follow these key principles:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Maintain High Contrast:</strong> A dark foreground on a light background is essential. While you can customize colors, avoid combinations like light yellow on white or dark blue on black.</li>
              <li><strong>Respect the Quiet Zone:</strong> Always leave a clear, empty margin around your QR code. A margin of at least four modules' width is recommended.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't Over-Stylize:</strong> While adding a logo can be great for branding, ensure it doesn't obscure too much of the data area, especially the corner position markers. Always use a high error correction level (H) when adding a logo.</li>
              <li><strong>Provide a Call to Action (CTA):</strong> Don't just place a QR code without context. Tell people what to expect. Use a short, clear CTA like "Scan for Menu," "Watch a Demo," or "Get 20% Off."</li>
              <li><strong>Test, Test, Test:</strong> Before printing thousands of copies, test your QR code thoroughly with different devices (iOS, Android) and scanning apps to ensure it works reliably.</li>
              <li><strong>Use an Appropriate Size:</strong> For print, a QR code should generally be at least 1 x 1 inch (2.5 x 2.5 cm) to be easily scannable from a reasonable distance. The required size depends on the scanning distance.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 id="data-capacity">QR Code Versions and Data Capacity (Data Table)</h3>
            <p>QR codes come in different "versions," from Version 1 (21x21 modules) to Version 40 (177x177 modules). Each subsequent version adds more modules, increasing the amount of data it can store. The table below illustrates the maximum data capacity for numeric and alphanumeric characters at different versions with Level M error correction.</p>

            <h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>Do QR codes expire?</dt>
              <dd>Static QR codes, like the ones created here, do not expire. They will work as long as the data they point to (e.g., the website link) is still active. Dynamic QR codes can "expire" if the subscription to the service that manages them is cancelled.</dd>
              
              <dt>Can I use these QR codes for commercial purposes?</dt>
              <dd>Absolutely. All QR codes generated by this tool are completely free to use for any purpose, including commercial projects, advertising, and product packaging.</dd>

              <dt>Why is my QR code not scanning?</dt>
              <dd>The most common reasons are: 1) Low contrast between the foreground and background colors. 2) The code is too small or blurry. 3) There isn't a sufficient quiet zone (white space) around the code. 4) The data encoded is too complex for the size, making the pattern very dense.</dd>
